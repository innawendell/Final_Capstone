Currently, humans write ads themselves, however, this genre has many "go-to" clich√©s. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to create a product that helps people save time by automating the process of ad creation. In this project, I explore some possible solutions to this challenge:

2) First experimental work towards generating ads texts from scratch
